To register the CAPE-OPEN unit operation:

1) register the VBMixerSplitterExample.dll as COM object

    regsvr32.exe VBMixerSplitterExample.dll

2) add the additional registry entries in VbMixSplitUnitOp.reg

In Win-64 environments, step 2 must be done from a 32-bit 
context; either explicitly using RegEdt32.exe or from a 32-bit
command prompt.

Please note that administration rights are required for object
registration. 

Please note that step 1 is performed by the Visual Basic
compiler during compilation, and that compilation must 
therefore be followed by step 2.
